# Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

## Warmup
During the course and readings, we covered some Data Structures.
Since a data structure is `a particular way of organizing and storing data` different data structures do the same job in different ways. Those differences can be understood by explaining how the data structure work and organizes data, also Operational Complexity (Big O).

## Objective

Describe the covered data structures: in a seperate .md file write list data structures.
Under each data structure describe how they work (design and operations), where they are used, and Big O (both average and worst).
Once done the do a pull request, One request per team.

## Hint
Data Structures we covered: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Sets, Binary Trees, Tries, and Balancing Binary Trees (AVL Tree).
